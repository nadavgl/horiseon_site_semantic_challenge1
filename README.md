# horiseon_site_semantic_challenge1

## Description

For this challenge I made the following changes to the html to increase the SEO potential.
    -Changed the generic element name to the correct semantic element tag
    -Added alt attribute descriptions to each image to increase the accesibilty of the page.

This challenge increased my vocublary of semantic html tags as well as the importance of adding accessibilty to web pages.

## Installation

-   Went through each generic "Div" tag on the HTML code and determined if a specfic semantic element tag can be used instead.
-   Made sure the H tag heirachy's correct
-   Added alt attribute descriptions to all pictures on the page.



## Usage

Below is an image of the screenshot of the updated the site.
